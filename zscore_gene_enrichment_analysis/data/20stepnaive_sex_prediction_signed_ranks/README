These files are the signed ranks resulting from naive sex prediction.
Data was (asinh trans for RNAseq) and z-scored across samples. For each gene, a cutoff that best separated male samples from female samples was found (measured with balanced accuracy). The balanced accuracy of a gene at the best cutoff was recorded, and if male expression was higher for the best balanced accuracy, the balanced accuracy was subtracted from one so that each balanced accuracy is effectively the balanced accuracy if female expression were predicted higher. These balanced accuracies were then multiplied by 2 and 1 was subtracted to get a final value in the -1 to 1 range (more male biased closer to -1 and more female biased closer to 1). For the genes in RNAseq that did not have enough variation to get a proper zscore, the final value was 0, indicating it is not male or female biased.
